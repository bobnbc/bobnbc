- 👋 Hi, I’m @bobnbc (even though I don't work at NBC anymore ;-)
- 👀 I love figuring stuff out.
- 🌱 I’ve been working with Drupal for a while now. In fact, according to Drupal.org, I'm 14 years old.
- 💞️ I’m currently supervising a top-notch Web team at the New Jersey Judiciary. It's an honor to be a state-appointed public servant.
